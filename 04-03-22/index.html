    	   		<p> Words matter, and terms can be slippery. You may see this body of text between two big air quotes. It is written by a "normal" weight brain with two hands and ten fingers. It is visible, readable, and reviewable. It’s constructed inside. Yet, it is about the invisible edge that created the dichotomy in the first place. It’s about the ones that will never be able again. The human beings that cannot remigrate to the center, slowly falling off the bittersweet margins into eternal silence. Therefore, this exploration offers a petite peeking hole from inside. Like Plato, slipping into his own cave.<sup>1</sup></p>

    	   		<p>The public health domain is a place that we all share. In the light of our current situation, human interdependency is becoming more tangible. While this ecosystem of health reveals itself, national lockdowns and self-isolation policies are implemented as an act of care. Yet this also triggers a counter reaction of independency and individualism. In the same breath, populist leaders like Bolsonaro promote gun possession while abandoning COVID-19 as an innocent flu.2 The strong white man can do it himself! Phenomena like Brexit and Trump shows isolationist tendencies on the global stage. But their campaigns also tap into a sentiment of individual self-containment and independency. Sentiments of neoliberal ableism may sound catchy and appealing, yet they also create a division between abled and disabled.3 </p>

    	   		<p>(Not) surprisingly this doesn’t only stay in the medical domain. It’s treacherous how quickly the sentiment of medical ableism finds its way as a political tool of othering. The disability justice framework as developed in 2005 by the Disability Justice Collectivea, examines ableism in relation to other forms of oppression and identity (race, class, gender, nation, and sexual orientation). It theorizes disability as a cultural, political, and social phenomenon, rather an individualized, medical matter attached to the body. “Disability is not defined in white terms, or male terms, or straight terms” "ableism helps make racism, Christian supremacy, sexism, and queer- and transphobia possible" (Piepzna-Samarasinha, 2018). All systems of oppression are intertwined.</p>

    			<p>“Asylum”</p>
    	   	</div>
   			<div class="collumn_bread">
    	   		<p>It is no coincidence that the word “asylum” refers to institutionalized places for both refugees, and people suffering from a mental disorder.6 Both are places far from home. Both enclose marginalized bodies. Both trigger social alienation. Analyzing society’s view on mental disability inevitably leads to insights concerning other labels of otherness. But perhaps the most profound similarity between both places is their paradoxical relationship with accessibility. To make this point clear, I like to give the example of the social model of disability which was developed by disability activist Vic Finkelstein in the 70s. In short it means that a person isn’t disabled because of their impairment, health condition, or the ways in which they may differ from what is commonly considered the medical ‘norm’; rather it is the physical and attitudinal barriers in society - prejudice, lack of access adjustments and systematic exclusion - that disable people.7 At the orthopedic clinic, accessibility is everything. Wheelchair ramps and elevators make sure patients can easily enter and move freely through the building. At the mental asylum, inaccessibility is everything. Often, it’s one way-in one-way out. In fact, it’s built to exclude. Just as refugees are temporary kept away in an in-between states space.</p>

   			<div class="collumn_bread">
    	   		<p>Fortunately, the mental asylum does not (really) exist anymore. As part of the world-wide deinstitutionalization process of the 20th century, the asylum made way for less isolated mental health services.8 Key-figures like Franco Basaglia and Ervin Goffman pleated for a more existential approach, countering the ‘total institution’. Complete isolation and psychopathological treatments were slowly reformed into less “penetrating” health services and provided “more freedom” to patients. Stays where shortened and admission rates reduced. This didn’t mean that the psychiatric domain suddenly became a place for freedom and equality. With the discovery of psychiatric drugs, the architectural confinement could be substituted by medicinal prescriptions. The healthcare environment became more specialized and fragmented into different narrowed care facilities. Formats such as assisted living, therapy groups, halfway houses and inpatient clinics all originated from that time. </p>

    	   		<p>Although deinstitutionalization was a world-wide process, the outcomes differed drastically.8 In fact, they still do. This thesis specifically explores the contemporary architectures encircling dementia care in The Netherlands. A country that has one of the most institutionalized elderly care systems in the world. In the Netherlands, about 115.000 people live in nursing homes.9 Roughly half of this group is afflicted by a psychogeriatric illness, mostly dementia. </p>

    	   		<p>What’s interesting about dementia, is that it a psychogeriatric illness that currently is not considered to be medically curable. It requires palliative care. People who suffer from dementia stay in residential care until the end of their lives. It’s their last resort. This means that the focus is on the well-being of its patients. A lot of innovation and technology flows into the salutogenic architectures that enclose residents with dementia. The main goal is to improve quality of living and the well-being of the people who are experiencing dementia.10 Nevertheless, these are still psychiatric care facilities with a (semi) locked-down structure, existing within a cramped market of austerity. On top of that there are currently about 290.000 people experiencing dementia in the Netherlands and it this number is likely to double by 2050 because of an increasing life expectancy.11</p>
