    	   		<p> Words matter, and terms can be slippery. You may see this body of text between two big air quotes. It is written by a "normal" weight brain with two hands and ten fingers. It is visible, readable, and reviewable. It’s constructed inside. Yet, it is about the invisible edge that created the dichotomy in the first place. It’s about the ones that will never be able again. The human beings that cannot remigrate to the center, slowly falling off the bittersweet margins into eternal silence. Therefore, this exploration offers a petite peeking hole from inside. Like Plato, slipping into his own cave.<sup>1</sup></p>

    	   		<p>The public health domain is a place that we all share. In the light of our current situation, human interdependency is becoming more tangible. While this ecosystem of health reveals itself, national lockdowns and self-isolation policies are implemented as an act of care. Yet this also triggers a counter reaction of independency and individualism. In the same breath, populist leaders like Bolsonaro promote gun possession while abandoning COVID-19 as an innocent flu.2 The strong white man can do it himself! Phenomena like Brexit and Trump shows isolationist tendencies on the global stage. But their campaigns also tap into a sentiment of individual self-containment and independency. Sentiments of neoliberal ableism may sound catchy and appealing, yet they also create a division between abled and disabled.3 </p>

    	   		<p>(Not) surprisingly this doesn’t only stay in the medical domain. It’s treacherous how quickly the sentiment of medical ableism finds its way as a political tool of othering. The disability justice framework as developed in 2005 by the Disability Justice Collective, examines ableism in relation to other forms of oppression and identity (race, class, gender, nation, and sexual orientation). It theorizes disability as a cultural, political, and social phenomenon, rather an individualized, medical matter attached to the body. “Disability is not defined in white terms, or male terms, or straight terms” "ableism helps make racism, Christian supremacy, sexism, and queer- and transphobia possible" (Piepzna-Samarasinha, 2018). All systems of oppression are intertwined.</p>

   			<div class="collumn_bread">
    	   		<p>It is no coincidence that the word “asylum” refers to institutionalized places for both refugees, and people suffering from a mental disorder.6 Both are poorly taken care of. Both are places far from home. Both enclose marginalized bodies. Analyzing society’s view on mental disability inevitably leads to insights concerning other labels of otherness. But perhaps their most profound similarity is their paradoxical relationship with accessibility. At the orthopedic clinic, accessibility is everything. Wheelchair ramps and elevators make sure patients can easily enter and move freely through the building. At the mental asylum, inaccessibility is everything. Often, it’s one way-in one-way out. In fact, it’s built to exclude as a way of protection. Just as refugees are temporary pushed away to the margins of society.</p>

   			<div class="collumn_bread">
    	   		<p>Fortunately, the mental asylum does not (really) exist anymore. As part of the world-wide deinstitutionalization process of the 20th century, the asylum made way for less isolated mental health services.8 Key-figures like Franco Basaglia and Ervin Goffman pleated for a more existential approach, countering the ‘total institution’. Complete isolation and psychopathological treatments were slowly reformed into less “penetrating” health services and provided “more freedom” to patients. Stays where shortened and admission rates reduced. This didn’t mean that the psychiatric domain suddenly became a place for freedom and equality. With the discovery of psychiatric drugs, the architectural confinement could be substituted by medicinal prescriptions. The healthcare environment became more specialized and fragmented into different narrowed care facilities. Formats such as assisted living, therapy groups, halfway houses and inpatient clinics all originated from that time. </p>

    			<p>5<br>Dutch Dementia </p>

   			<div class="collumn_bread">
    	   		<p>The setting in which care is provided differs drastically around the world. This thesis specifically explores the contemporary architectures encircling dementia care in The Netherlands. A country that has one of the most institutionalized elderly care systems in the world. In the Netherlands, about 115.000 people live in elderly homes.9 Roughly half of this group is afflicted by dementia. There are currently about 290.000 people experiencing dementia in the Netherlands and it this number is likely to double by 2050 because of an increasing life expectancy.11 So ironically, this rising number of dementia patients is due to the improvements in healthcare. </p>

   			<div class="collumn_bread">
    	   		<p>Currently, dementia is a psychogeriatric illness that is not considered to be medically curable. For people with dementia this often means that the elderly home is their last resort. It requires palliative care, which means that the well-being is more important than caregiving. This demands a huge responsibility from the care environment itself. With an already urgent shortage in caregivers and a market full of cuts, the setting surrounding people experiencing dementia is the absolute bearer of their well-being. </p>

    	   		<p>These architectural settings are obviously designed and have come a long way from the alienating pre-second-world-war asylum. Visual stimulation, music, and tactile experiences within the environment may create meaningful experiences for its residents. Nevertheless, they are still locked off institutions and the credibility of the escapist mediation moments depends on the wealth of the patient. From a badly painted grassland mural to real indoor golf-courts. This essay will explore this spectrum of luxurious escapism in a country that could be considered one big company.  </p>
