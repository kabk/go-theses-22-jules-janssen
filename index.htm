							Words matter, and terms can be slippery. You may see this body of text between two big air quotes. It is written by a "normal" weight brain with two hands and ten fingers. It is visible, readable, and reviewable. It’s constructed inside. Yet, it is about the invisible edge that created the dichotomy in the first place. It’s about the ones that will never be able again. The human beings that cannot remigrate to the center, slowly falling off the bittersweet margins into eternal silence. Therefore, this exploration offers a petite peeking hole from inside. Like Plato, slipping into his own cave.<sup>1</sup>

							The public health domain is a place we all share. In the light of our current situation, human interdependency is becoming more tangible. While this ecosystem of health revealed itself, national lockdowns and self-isolation policies were implemented as an act of care. Yet this also triggered a counter reaction of independency and individualism. In the same breath, populist leaders like Bolsonaro promoted gun possession while abandoning COVID-19 as an innocent flu.<sup>3</sup> Sudden manifestations of our fragile existence seem to ignite patriarchal enmity. Phenomena like Brexit and Trump shows isolationist tendencies on the global stage. But their campaigns also tap into a sentiment of individual self-containment and independency. The strong man can do it himself. These sentiments of neoliberal ableism may sound catchy to some, yet they automatically enable division.<sup>4</sup>

							(Not) Surprisingly this doesn’t only stay in the medical domain. It’s treacherous how quickly the sentiment of medical ableism finds its way as a tool of othering. The disability justice framework as developed in 2005 by the Disability Justice Collective, examines ableism in relation to other forms of oppression and identity. It theorizes disability as a cultural, political, and social phenomenon, rather an individualized, medical matter attached to the body. It examines how ableism makes racism, Christian supremacy, sexism, and queer- and transphobia possible.<sup>5</sup> While these are just a few power mechanisms, all systems of oppression are intertwined. “Historically, the notions of nature and culture tend to mirror and reshape one another, providing a battleground for the inclusion and exclusion of certain bodies (both human and non-human)” (Marques, 1).

							It is no coincidence that the word “asylum” refers to institutionalized places for both refugees, and people suffering from a mental disorder.<sup>6</sup>  Both are places far from home and both enclose marginalized bodies. Analyzing society’s view on mental disability inevitably leads to insights concerning other labels of otherness. But perhaps their most profound similarity is their paradoxical relationship with accessibility. At the orthopedic clinic, accessibility is everything. Wheelchair ramps and elevators make sure patients can easily enter and move freely through the building. At the mental asylum, inaccessibility is everything. It’s built to exclude, in order to protect “both sides" of the wall.

							The mental asylum as we once knew it does not really exist anymore. As part of the world-wide deinstitutionalization process of the 20th century, the asylum made way for less isolated mental health services.<sup>7</sup> Key-figures like Franco Basaglia and Ervin Goffman pleated for a more existential approach, countering the ‘total institution’. Complete isolation and psychopathological treatments were slowly reformed into less “penetrating” health services and provided “more freedom” to patients. Stays where shortened and admission rates reduced. This didn’t mean that the psychiatric domain suddenly became a place for freedom and equality. With the discovery of psychiatric drugs, the architectural confinement could be substituted by medicinal prescriptions. The healthcare environment became more specialized and fragmented into different narrowed care facilities. Formats such as assisted living, therapy groups, halfway houses and inpatient clinics all originated from that time.

							The current setting in which care is provided, differs drastically around the world. This thesis specifically explores the contemporary architectures encircling dementia care in The Netherlands. A country that is heavily capitalized, densely populated and has one of the most institutionalized elderly care systems in the world. In the Netherlands, about 115.000 people live in elderly homes.<sup>8</sup> Roughly half of this group is afflicted by dementia. There are currently about 290.000 people experiencing dementia in the Netherlands and it this number is likely to double by 2050 because of an increasing life expectancy.<sup>9</sup>

					<div class="bread_column">
						<p>
							Dementia is where the advancements in health science are confronted with a dead end. It’s a psychogeriatric condition that is not considered to be medically curable. For people with dementia this often means that the elderly home is their last resort. It requires palliative care, which means that the well-being is more important than the caregiving. This demands a huge responsibility from the care environment itself. With an already urgent shortage in caregivers and a market full of cuts, the setting surrounding people experiencing dementia is the absolute bearer of their well-being.

							This results in countless tayloristic rituals, captured in Excel sheets, about the right amount of light, the ideal television volume, and the average length of walks through the courtyard. But these institutional settings don’t just provide daily routine. Design interventions offer a lighting consolation for an architectural reality in which the walls are closing in. They effectively tap into a brain condition in which reality is already wavering. If we can’t play God, we can at least simulate God: murals, decors, music, and innovative simulators tend to bring residents back to the brighter days of tactile autonomy. The credibility of these escapist mediation moments depends on the pockets of the pensionado in a country that has little room for the ill.

							My grandma called me Wouter instead of Jules and offered me a biscuit each ten minutes. Every two weeks on a Sunday we would drive from Eindhoven to the nursing home in Bergen. We always stayed for two hours. I used to draw armless people in her room after which she would ask if I was left-handed. “Wouter is left-handed, isn’t he?” “Wouter is left-handed, isn’t he?” She passed away in October 2010. We never visited the nursing home in which she lived again. Thinking about it now, makes me remember how I used to run laps through the unit. It felt like an infinite corridor, like an endless world. The building was circular, had vinyl floors and semi-automatic push bar doors. In the middle was a little park with an artificial lake. All residents of the unit suffered from dementia.

							Isolation derives from the Latin word “isola”, meaning island.<sup>1</sup> The closed character of the memory care institution seems to be born out of modern necessity. The cortex of the human brain is humanly divided in different islands that all have different functions: forming memories, processing sound, speech production, all that jazz.<sup>2</sup> The logic of everyday rationale is often based on similar mappings. The way in which your home is ordered, how city districts are divided and how food is categorized in supermarkets. It’s exactly in these architectural settings that things start to get lost.

							Cell derives from the Latin word “cellula”, meaning “small room”.<sup>3</sup> The dementia care environment may serve as a direct analogy between the brain and the building. A healthy brain probably weighs about 1300 to 1400 kilograms. When you are in the process of depersonalizing, the environment surrounding you seems to do the same. In an Alzheimer brain plagues and tangles block the cell transport system resulting in a dysfunctional cell transport system. Nutrients and other essential supplies can no longer move through the cells. Neurons die throughout the brain, connections between networks of neurons break down and cells die.<sup>4</sup> In the last stage of Alzheimer, a brain weights 1100 – 1200 grams.<sup>5</sup> Daily life becomes unbearable, especially in countries with a lot of roads. Trapped in the boundaries of protocol, only a tiny fragment of personal belongings makes it into the dementia unit.

							As one goes through the different stages of dementia, communication abilities start to decline. Forgetting a name or coming up with the right word are the first appearances of a downwards fall into depersonalization. While these ‘language errors’ are still relatively insignificant, in the last stage of dementia, verbal communication becomes grueling or even impossible. To make sure visual language speaks to everybody, recognizable representations are used. Semiotics and symbols are used to appeal to the collective unconsciousness. Here, individuation of modern life seems to find its way back to the archaic to ensure interaction with all the decaying brains in the building.

							What makes this building-sized language even more specific is the aspect of memory. The fabric of life seems to be captured in this word. Memory is not a single process in the brain. Those with Alzheimer’s disease may have impairments in short-term memory, however remote memory can be left relatively intact. So, they’re able to remember public and personal events many decades ago, but unable to recall what happened earlier that day.<sup>6</sup> Like a blind person having a better hearing than an abled person, someone with dementia might suddenly recall a memory that she/he/they couldn’t before. For people with a migration background phenomenon, language reversion might occur. It is characterized by patients suddenly switching back to their first language after speaking a different language for decades.<sup>7</sup>

							I’ve never happened to know my great grandmother. She grew up in late 19th century Cologne. Raised in a catholic environment she never talked about sexually explicit topics. It was a taboo. But at the time she started to experience dementia, she suddenly became a real flirt. Openly she told my grandma how she had a crush on the doctor, who happened to be thirty years younger. In Dutch this type of behavior is called decorumverlies, which literally means loss of décor. It is characterized by behavior that is “inappropriate” in the social environment of that specific moment. As one goes through different stages of dementia, one loses the presence of the social environment. This has to do with the decline of abilities a person learnt specifically when growing up as an adult. An emotion such as shame is learnt along the way of growing up, as one explores what’s acceptable behavior and what is not. An abled brain might perceive this as childish...

							Progression and constant grow seem to be all we want to know. But like a flower losing its leaves, dementia loops back into the renversement of time. When looking from an outsider perspective at the dementia care environment, the day-care association is never far away. The retro-genesis theory suggests that brain decline mirrors brain development from birth. Stages of Alzheimer are compared with the cognitive and motor abilities of a child of certain age, e.g. a person in the early stages of dementia will have the skill level of a 5 to 7 year old.

							In the last stage of dementia, all that there is often left is touch. Being the primacy of all senses, touch forms the core of human existence. It’s the first sense to develop in the fetus. 9 “A new-born baby is not aware of the fact that sounds, and movement, sight and touch are different things. All impressions melt in a single experience or feeling together” (Goddard, 2005).10 The balance mechanism acts as a kind of compass in the body that continuously monitors the other systems, by which we obtain the feeling of where we are in space.

						When thinking of the healthcare environment, you might think of a giant ‘H’, sealed white workers, and other standardized systems of sameness. A medical space, dominated by an aura that helps us believe that we will be cured. A Not the environment to stick around for fun. Yet, healthcare architecture tried to shift away from this horror trope since the fifties. The ‘Form follows function’ credo slowly made way for Postmodernism and its escapades. During the postwar economic boom, health architecture aimed at normalizing, or better said, capitalizing the healthcare environment: instead of focusing on physicians, architects focused on patients and families. It was purposely anti-medical.1 With the advent of New Urbanism during the 80s, hospitals started to look like mall or airports, offering retail, dining, and healing gardens. Landmarks helped to find patient-consumers find their way and distracted patients of being seriously ill. Sometimes the hospital-as-city metaphor was so explicit, with corridors as streets, as if outside, with ‘street’ lighting and benches, giving the hospital an aura of being public.2

					 	Currently, a growing part of healthcare architecture seems to underline a view of salutogenesis as an addition to pathogenesis. In Pedro Reyes’ Nine Tenets of the Sanatorium and Sanatorium Manifesto, he explains this view as “Health is not the absence of disease. It’s a state in which we know that life is manageable and meaningful: it’s how we retain our ability to keep going when facing changes internally and externally. These therapies are an extensional device to enhance your present state, to help you find your sweet spot” (Reyes, 82.)

					 	All of the above adds to the dazzling grab bag in which some dementia patients are accommodated. A parody on life as a parody: a simulacrum.a “In a true fictional experience, we know that we exist in two worlds at once: the real world in which we exist, and the fictional one we enact (through architecture, books, film, music, etc.). The residents of the dementia village know only one world. Architecture for dementia indicates where fictional experiences cross a line into another state, where there is no longer an awareness of enacting a fiction. In the dementia village, it’s all enactment” (Adams, Chivers). An enactment that could be more, or less true, based on the wealth of the accommodated individual.

							<h3>
               				A Jean Baudrillard in "The Precession of Simulacra" defines this term as follows: "Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal.... It is no longer a question of imitation, nor duplication, nor even parody. It is a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real" (1-2).
