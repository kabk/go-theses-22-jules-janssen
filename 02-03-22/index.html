    				<p> Words matter, and terms can be slippery. You may see this body of text between two big air quotes. It is written by a normal weight brain with two hands and ten fingers. It is visible, readable, and reviewable. It’s constructed inside. Yet, it is about the invisible edge that created the dichotomy in the first place. It’s about the ones that will never be able again. The human beings that cannot remigrate to the center, slowly falling off the bittersweet margins into eternal silence. Therefore, this exploration offers a petite peeking hole from inside. Like Plato, slipping into his own cave.<sup>1</sup>

            		<p>The public health domain is a place that we all share. In the light of our current situation, human interdependency is becoming more tangible. While this ecosystem of health reveals itself, national lockdowns and self-isolation policies are implemented as an act of care. Yet this also triggers a counter reaction of independency and individualism. In the same breath, populist leaders like Bolsonaro promote gun possession while abandoning COVID-19 as an innocent flu.<sup>2</sup> The strong man can do it himself, “what he says” goes. Phenomena like Brexit and Trump shows isolationist tendencies on the global stage. But their campaigns also tap into a sentiment of individual self-containment and independency. These sentiments of neoliberal ableism may sound catchy and appealing, yet they also create a division between abled and disabled.<sup>3</sup> And this doesn’t only stay in the medical domain. It is treacherous how quickly the sentiment of medical ableism finds its way as a political tool of othering. People like Melinda Hall call this Critical disability theory. “Critical disability theories try to theorize disability a diverse set of approaches that largely seek to theorize disability as a cultural, political, and social phenomenon, rather than an individualized, medical matter attached to the body” (Hall, 2019). They intend to capture a broaden field of |materialist accounts of disability including race, class, gender, nation, and sexual orientation. Ableism automatically pushes the other to the margins. “Only sanitized active bodies are allowed to fully participate in society and obtain visibility through its media” (Munoz 13).  </p>

		            <p>It is no coincidence that the word “asylum” refers to institutionalized places for both refugees, and people suffering from a mental disorder.<sup>6</sup> Both are places far from home. Both enclose marginalized bodies. Both trigger social alienation. Analyzing society’s view on mental disability inevitably leads to insights concerning other labels of otherness. But perhaps the most profound similarity between both places is their paradoxical relationship with accessibility. To make this point clear, I like to give the example of the social model of disability which was developed by disability activist Vic Finkelstein in the 70s. It’s a way of thinking about disability, that shows the world how to include disabled people. In short it means that a person isn’t disabled because of their impairment, health condition, or the ways in which they may differ from what is commonly considered the medical ‘norm’; rather it is the physical and attitudinal barriers in society - prejudice, lack of access adjustments and systematic exclusion - that disable people.<sup>7</sup> At the orthopedic clinic, accessibility is everything. Wheelchair ramps and elevators make sure patients can easily enter and move freely through the building. At the mental asylum, inaccessibility is everything. Often, it’s one way-in one-way out. In fact, it’s built to exclude. Just as refugees are temporary kept away in a marginal in-between space.
