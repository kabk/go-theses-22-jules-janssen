    		<p> Words matter, and terms can be slippery. You may see this body of text between two big air quotes. It is written by a normal weight brain with two hands and ten fingers. It is visible, readable, and reviewable. It’s constructed inside. Yet, it is about the invisible edge that created the dichotomy in the first place. It’s about the ones that will never be able again. The human beings that cannot remigrate to the center, slowly falling off the bittersweet margins into eternal silence. Therefore, this exploration offers a petite peeking hole from inside. Like Plato, slipping into his own cave.1 </p>

            <p> The public health domain is a place that we all share. In the light of our current situation, human interdependency is becoming more tangible. While this ecosystem of health reveals itself, national lockdowns and self-isolation policies are implemented as an act of care. Yet this also triggers a counter reaction of independency and individualism. In the same breath, populist leaders like Bolsonaro promote gun possession while abandoning COVID-19 as an innocent flu.2 The strong man can do it himself, what he says goes. Phenomena like Brexit and Trump shows isolationist tendencies on the global stage. But their campaigns also tap into a sentiment of individual self-containment and independency. These sentiments of neoliberal ableism may sound catchy and appealing, yet they also create a division between abled and disabled.3 And this doesn’t only stay in the medical domain. It is treacherous how quickly the sentiment of medical ableism finds its way as a political tool of othering. People like Melinda Hall call this Critical disability theory. “Critical disability theories try to theorize disability a diverse set of approaches that largely seek to theorize disability as a cultural, political, and social phenomenon, rather than an individualized, medical matter attached to the body” (Hall, 2019). They intend to capture a broaden field of |materialist accounts of disability including race, class, gender, nation, and sexual orientation. Ableism automatically pushes the disabled to the margins. “Only sanitized active bodies are allowed to fully participate in society and obtain visibility through its media” (Munoz 13).

            <p> Jules Janssen was actually wondering why we always talk in third-person on the web. Like as if Jules Janssen is a brand. Yuk! It's just a person, like you and me. But if I would be talking in the first person, I'm forced to introduce myself somewhere. “I am Jules Janssen, and I am a designer.” Cogito ergo sum type-o-way! Plus, I would never be able to put my name first in the sentence, which is kind of problematic in terms of UXD. So messy! So let's keep it pratical: Jules Janssen (1995) is a graphic designer from The Netherlands who is currently studying at KABK, The Hague. Specialized in visual identities, aesthetic ministrations and printed matter. Strongly believes in mistakes and likes to assume that swimming against the current while making grand gestures of subjectivity can help the community. For commissions, collaborations and chats: <a class= "green" href="tel:+31639277146">+31(0)639277146</a>, <a class= "green" href="mailto:info@julesjanssen.be">  info@julesjanssen.be</a>,<a class="green" href="https://www.instagram.com/julescrepuul"> Instagram.</a>
